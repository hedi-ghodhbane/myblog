CATEO was my internship Project. It means a lot to me although it was never shipped to production. This project changed everything for me - I went from learning TypeScript to teaching it to the team.

## My Impact

I learned TypeScript from Frontend Masters and just a month later, the CTO asked me to give a talk about it. He was shocked when I told him I just learned it. After my talk, he actually changed some production code to follow what I showed them.

I also helped the team with DynamoDB. My single-table design was so good that it made them rethink how they were doing their database. They started using my approach in other projects too.

## The idea

CATEO was meant to help HR teams build custom candidate experience using custom widgets. By creating widgets, then drag-drop them to a template to be later custom for each candidate/job.

## What I built

- Markdown editor using lexical 
- Adding custom nodes/entries to the editor such as QA sections/youtube videos/custom UI.
- Drag-drop feature to build custom templates
- A landing page using Storybook as a CMS and Next.js 12 with SSR/ISG
