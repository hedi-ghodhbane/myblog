## The idea

Strutio was an early-stage startup idea. It was designed to make software builds easy to distribute, discover, and install. 
I, along with two engineers, believed in the concept and began developing the product directly. 
The project is currently discontinued.  

## Complex features
- Secure upload/download
- Easy magic link signup/login
- UX friendly filtering
- Caching for smooth UX & performance 

## What We Learned
- Business and marketing are the most important aspects; anyone can build a product.
- Don't start building a product immediately; instead, create a prototype and gather early feedback.
- It has never been easier to build web applications than it is today, thanks to advancements in web technologies and UI frameworks.
